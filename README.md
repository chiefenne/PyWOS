Monte Carlo method based on a walk-on-spheres implementation for solving a 2D Poisson PDE written in Python.

Based on the excellent [video](https://youtu.be/bZbuKOxH71o) by Keenan Crane from Carnegie Mellon University and a code snippet he provided [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/MonteCarloGeometryProcessing/WoSPoisson2D.cpp.html).

The version presented here utilizes recursion.
