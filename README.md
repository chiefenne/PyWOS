Monte Carlo method based on walk-on-speres implementation for solving a 2D Poisson PDE.

Based on the [video](https://youtu.be/bZbuKOxH71o) by Keenan Crane from Carnegie Mellon University and a code snippet he provided [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/MonteCarloGeometryProcessing/WoSPoisson2D.cpp.html).
